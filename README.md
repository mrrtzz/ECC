# ECC Elliptic curve cryptography 
in this Repo we will aim to answer multiple questions in the elliptic curves Cryptography, including relevant number theory procedures and use of elliptic curves for encryption, key exchange and digital signature by using python. 

## Inverse Euclidean algorithm 
### Finding the inverse value of an integer modulo P where P is a prime number
usually if some one asks you this question they will give you the question like following.
q: create or construct a program implementing euclidean algorithm in which the inputs are a and p where p is prime and a!=kp and the output is a^(-1) mod p
# Definition 
integer b is the inverse of integer a mod p where a.b = 1 mod p
